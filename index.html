            This is an interactive web map of the New York City subway system. 
            The data displayed shows average weekday ridership numbers across the entire city 
            from 2015-2020. 2020 saw a massive dip in ridership as the COVID-19 pandemic kept 
            many commuters at home throughout the year. Times Square/42nd street, NYC’s busiest 
            station, saw a 68.7% decrease in ridership as a result. In 2019 there was an average of 
            205,159 riders per weekday, but in 2020 the average fell to 64,301. Grand Central 
            Station/42nd Street, NYC’s second busiest station saw a similar pattern, decreasing 71.5% 
            from 2019 to 2020. In 2019 there was an average of 157,273 riders per weekday, and in 2020 
            the average fell to 44,778.
