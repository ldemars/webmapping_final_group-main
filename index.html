            This is an interactive web map of the New York City subway system. 
            The data displayed shows average weekday ridership numbers across the entire city 
            from 2015-2020. 2020 saw a massive dip in ridership as the COVID-19 pandemic kept 
            many commuters at home throughout the year. Times Square/42nd street, NYC’s busiest 
            station, saw a 68.7% decrease in ridership as a result. In 2019 there was an average of 
            205,159 riders per weekday, but in 2020 the average fell to 64,301. Grand Central 
            Station/42nd Street, NYC’s second busiest station saw a similar pattern, decreasing 71.5% 
            from 2019 to 2020. In 2019 there was an average of 157,273 riders per weekday, and in 2020 
            the average fell to 44,778.

            The New York City Subway system is not only one of the largest in the world, but also one of the 
            oldest, having opened its first line in 1904. Today, the subway comprises 472 stations, making it 
            the most extensive public transportation system in the United States. The subway initially consisted 
            of a single line, but it quickly grew to cover the entire city, providing residents with a fast and 
            efficient means of transportation. Over the years, the subway has faced numerous challenges, including 
            severe financial difficulties, aging infrastructure, and natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. 
            Despite these challenges, the subway continues to operate 24/7 and serves millions of passengers each day. 
            Some interesting facts about the New York City Subway include its use as a filming location for countless 
            movies and TV shows, the presence of abandoned stations and tunnels that have been repurposed or remain unused,
             and the unique tile artwork and mosaics found in many stations.
